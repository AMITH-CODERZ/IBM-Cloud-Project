# ⚡ Power System Fault Detection and Classification

## 🧠 Problem Statement 41 – IBM Cloud Internship Project

This project aims to design a machine learning model to **detect and classify faults in a power distribution system** using electrical measurements such as voltage and current phasors. The goal is to distinguish between normal conditions and various fault types — such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults — enabling **rapid and accurate fault detection** crucial for maintaining power grid stability and reliability.
